  <h3>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2>Are you expensive?</h2>
      <p>
        No, we actually would love to raise our rates, but there is this thing
        called "economics" that doesn't help with this issue.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>What are your rates?</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Silence</em>...<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        Naaah, our rates range between US $ 25 for a Junior (not Rookie, <em>Junior</em>)
        Developer, to US $ 45 for a Senior Developer. But in the end it will depend
        on the project, required skills, contract conditions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Talking about contract conditions...</h2>
      <p>
        We are pretty flexible. Usully we invoice monthly the hours reported
        by the team assigned to your project, but we can make close bids also.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>How do you receive payments?</h2>
      <p>
        Wire transfers to any of our bank accounts in the US is fine. Sorry, we
        can't accepto PayPal fund transfers.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Where are you located?</h2>
      <p>
        We are based on Caracas, Venezuela. Our Time Zone is GMT -4:30, almost
        matching EST. We have worked with customers in Germany and Holland, and
        and as far as Hawaii too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our offices are located in a nice office complex in the capital, near
        a National Park. It is unusual to receive a visit from our overseas customers,
        but we really enjoy working here.

    <li>
      <h2>Do you really have experience?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. After a lot of years drinking only the J2EE Kool Aid thing, we jumped
        into <strong>Ruby On Rails</strong> with
        <a href="http://rubycorner.com/">http://rubycorner.com/</a> a Ruby/Rails
        resource long time listed in
        <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/weblogs/">http://ruby&#8209;lang.org/</a>.
        Since that, we have strongly focused in Rails development.

      <h2>I still have questions not answered here...</h2>
      <p>
         We will be more than happy to meet you in person, by phone, using Skype
         of in a IM chat. Please start by dropping us a note to
