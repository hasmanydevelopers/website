  <p>
    Pickista is a fun and simple way to ask a question. A visual poll that lets
    you get the answers you need, when you need them, from the people you trust.
    Using images to explain your dilemma in a nutshell, you can send your
    question to your most trusted advisors from anywhere on the web. With
    lightning-quick speed, we’ll tally their votes (or “picks”) for your 
    perusal.
