          <p>
            We think our work is the best advertising we have, so we offer you
            a trial of our web development services for one full week (5 days),
            more than enough for a small iteration.
          </p>        
          <h3>What's included?</h3>
          <p>
            One full time - <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> that will take
            care of all the programming (and related) tasks. The number of hours
            should not exceed eight daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            And one part time <strong>Senior Developer</strong> that will manage
            the project, a couple hours day is usually enough unless the project
            is really complex.
          </p>
          <h3>What if I don't like it?</h3>
          <p>
            In the unusual case that you prefer not to move your project forward
            with us, just keep all the work we have committed. No questions. No 
            strings attached.
          </p>
          <h3>What if I love working with you?</h3>
          <p>
            We will just keep working with you, and include this first week in 
            you first invoice. That's all.
          </p>
          <h3>Some restrictions apply...</h3>
          <p>
            As we are small team, we are only able to give away one Free Trial
            per month, and only to prospective customers with projects with an
            estimated span of three or more months.
